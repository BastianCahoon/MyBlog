Hello! This starts the beginning of my first formal blog post on the website. 

To start off, I started working on web development since the beginning of summer,
trying to figure out what I'm interested in doing once I've finished college.
My experience with web development hasn't been a lot because I haven't had any source
of accountability for my work. My first goal for this website was to show my current, and completed projects.
Unfortunately, I don't believe that I will be able to show at the very least my Mandelbrot project because of the
type of website this is(TLDR I think I need to build an application, and I have no clue how to implement that onto Gatsby).

I didn't realize how arduous of a task it would be to create a website with a python project would be (given that I understand how a good portion of it works).
For now, I have been distracting myself with courses that might be helpful, but I can't see far enough ahead to know...

Should I talk to someone more capable about what I should learn? 
Would it be worthwhile to interview them about their journey?
This seems like a lot, but first I should have a starting plan.

To be continued...
