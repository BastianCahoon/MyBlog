Hello all! It's been just about over a half week, and I've got a new idea to keep my skills 
sharp: Creating my own sudoku solver!!!

I started playing sudoku in seventh grade, and it just made sense. As far as i've understood from online
forums, it shouldn't be terribly hard to make. My whole aim is to make sure that my Python skills are 
still good, and that I remember how to make a good plan with OOP(Object Oriented Programming) in mind.

In the meanwhile, I might be interviewing a freelance developer soon! If everything goes well, I'll be
sure to post about it! 

Caio
